'''
1. create a function, to pass in two numerical parameter and, power the 1st parameter by 2 and square root 2nd parameter. then return the sum of computed result of of two parameters
     eg: 5, 36 are two parameters
         power of 5 = 25; and sq. root of 36 is 6
         then sum of 25 and 6 is 31. return the 31

2. create a function to pass in a string parameter, and return if the passed strnig to a function is a weekend or a weekday or not a day
    eg: if user calls a function with "sunday", the function should return a weekend
